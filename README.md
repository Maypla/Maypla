## Hi everyone, my name is Victor. 
In this repository I will tell a little about myself: 
At the moment I am studying on the course “Developer of neural networks”, I am 21 years old, so I think it's not too late :D. 
I have an incomplete secondary vocational education. 
I am passionate about programming, so I want to become highly skilled in neural network development. 
Now I just started the path of learning python, but in the future I hope to become a decent programmer and work on big projects.
